# Multiplier `+` Accumulator

A single line description of this project is `accumulator and multiplier for storing the product of two 8-bit numbers in vhdl`.

## Multiplier 
Code for multiplier [bootmult.vhdl](https://github.com/harsh-98/vhdl/blob/master/boothmult.vhdl). 

- It's role is multipling two numbers and passing the output to the [accum.vhdl](https://github.com/harsh-98/vhdl/blob/master/accum.vhdl).

## Accumulator + Adder
Code for accumulator [accum.vhdl](https://github.com/harsh-98/vhdl/blob/master/accumulator.vhdl). 

- It's role is adding output of multiplier to it's previous result and storing the result.

## Test bench

Code for testbench [tb_accum.vhdl](https://github.com/harsh-98/vhdl/blob/master/tb_accum.vhdl).

- It has some hard coded values for testing the implementation. `Feel free to change them`
